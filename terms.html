            By downloading or using the app, these terms will
            automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
            that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re
            not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app,
            or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt
            to extract the source code of the app, and you also
            shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or
            make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade
            marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual
            property rights related to it, still belong to
            Pavel Sulimau.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pavel Sulimau is committed to ensuring that the app
            is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
            reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge
            for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will
            never charge you for the app or its services without making
            it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
          </p>
          <p>
            The MemMe app stores and processes personal data
            that you have provided to us, in order to provide
            my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your
            phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend
            that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the
            process of removing software restrictions and limitations
            imposed by the official operating system of your device. It
            could make your phone vulnerable to
            malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
            security features and it could mean that the
            MemMe app won’t work properly or at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along the same lines, Pavel Sulimau cannot always
            take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You
            need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it
            runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the
            Service, Pavel Sulimau cannot accept
            responsibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            With respect to Pavel Sulimau’s responsibility for
            your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s
            important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to
            ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
            rely on third parties to provide information to us so that
            we can make it available to you.
            Pavel Sulimau accepts no liability for any loss,
            direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
            wholly on this functionality of the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
            currently available on iOS – the requirements for
            system (and for any additional systems we
            decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
            and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
            using the app. Pavel Sulimau does not promise that
            it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
            and/or works with the iOS version that you have
            installed on your device. However, you promise to always
            accept updates to the application when offered to you, We
            may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate
            use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
            to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination,
            (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms
            will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
            delete it from your device.
